We may ask you for information such as, but not limited to: your name, address, telephone number, and email address to process your submission.

                FightForMesothelioma.com does not collect your email address unless you actively provide it to the company so that we can communicate with you. When your Web browser or email application requests a Web page from another computer on the Internet it automatically gives that computer the address where the requested information should be sent. This is called your computer's "IP address." (IP stands for "Internet protocol.") For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up ISP, the IP address may be different every time you log on. FightForMesothelioma.com receives your IP address each time you view a Web page from the Site. Your IP address is not linked to your email address or any other personally identifiable information.
